 Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Create the `requirements.txt` File**
   - Open a text editor (like Notepad) and create a new file.
   - Add the following lines to the file:
     ```
     streamlit
     transformers
     torch
     ```
   - Save the file as `requirements.txt` in the `C:\Users\Administrator\text_summarization` directory.

2. **Install Required Packages**
   - After saving the `requirements.txt` file, go back to your command prompt.
   - Make sure you're still in the `text_summarization` directory:
     ```bash
     cd C:\Users\Administrator\text_summarization
     ```
   - Now, run the following command to install the required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Create the Python Files**
   - Create the `summary_model.py` file:
     - Open a text editor and add the following code:
       ```python
       from transformers import pipeline

       def summarize_text(text):
           summarizer = pipeline("summarization")
           summary = summarizer(text, max_length=130, min_length=30, do_sample=False)
           return summary[0]['summary_text']
       ```
     - Save this file as `summary_model.py` in the same directory.

   - Create the `app.py` file:
     - Open a text editor and add the following code:
       ```python
       import streamlit as st
       from summary_model import summarize_text

       st.title("Text Summarization App")

       input_text = st.text_area("Enter the text you want to summarize:", height=300)

       if st.button("Summarize"):
           if input_text:
               summary = summarize_text(input_text)
               st.subheader("Summary:")
               st.write(summary)
           else:
               st.error("Please enter some text to summarize.")
       ```
     - Save this file as `app.py` in the same directory.

4. **Run the Application**
   - In the command prompt, ensure youâ€™re still in the `text_summarization` directory and run:
     ```bash
     streamlit run app.py
     ```

5. **Access the Application**
   - After running the above command, open your web browser and go to the URL shown in the command prompt (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
